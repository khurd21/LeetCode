Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in
the array that occurs more than 25% of the time, return that integer.

### Example 1:

`Input:` arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]  
`Output:` 6  

### Example 2:

`Input:` arr = [1,1]  
`Output:` 1  

### Constraints:

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
